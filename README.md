## Hey hey :v:

### 👩‍💻Bio

🔭I am currently a **Course Developer** specializing in HTML and CSS. I also take on various front-end challenges on a day-to-day basis.

🌱 I am currently becoming more familiar with **JavaScript** via freeCodeCamp. I plan to learn other front-end libraries as well, including but not limited to **Bootstrap**, **jQuery**, **SASS**, **React**, and **Redux**.

🎮 In my spare time, I enjoy a variety of video games, including **Hades**, **Ori and the Blind Forest**, and **Persona**. My current obsession is **Lost Ark**.

🧗‍♀️ I'm an intermediate rock-climber at my local gym, and try to go at least once a week.

🫖 I love boba and teamaking in general. I have a collection of loose-leaf teas that I like to experiment with.
